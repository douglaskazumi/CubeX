The assignment was way more difficult than the previous ones. It was not easy to think of a solution for all of the problems that kept appearing, and there was a lot mechanical work.
Everybody worked together on physical meetings to think of solutions for the problems we had. Everybody had at least a little contribution on every part, but Philip and Douglas were mainly responsible for the actual solution code writing, while Alisson was mainly responsible for testing and debugging.
