This stage of the project was noticeably the most difficult so far. The group convened in the day that the assignment was release and outlined how to solve the problem and took the main decisions. Philip implemented mostly the cubex_lib, while Douglas implemented the Java part responsible to couple both.
During the project, Alisson's mother had health issues and underwent through 4 surgeries, so he wasn't able to effectively generate work, fact that influenced in the not completion of the assignment.
