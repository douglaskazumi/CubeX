I added the test rig code, but the other files for the project were not actually added/commited
 to the repository so i didn't actually get them. In terms of things that need to be done, we need
 to rerun antlr on the new grammar that we updated at our meeting today as well as compile everything
 into a jar and rerun the test just to make sure we didn't break anything.
