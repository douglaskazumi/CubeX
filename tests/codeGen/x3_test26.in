"You must employ a reasonable garbage collection strategy."
"Every block of allocated memory must be freed before the program terminates"
"(we will test this),"
"and furthermore must be freed as soon as it is no longer needed,"
"or some short time thereafter"
"(we will test this, also)."
"You should generate code that will compile on both 32 and 64 bit systems."
"Do not worry about arithmetic overflow problems."
"We promise not to use any grading tests that would overflow any reasonable implementation of Cubex arithmetic with 32-bit ints."
