A larger input.
We've decided not to burden you with reading a full semantics for the Cubex language.
That means that you should implement the "obvious" semantics of statements, expressions, classes, interfaces, et cetera.
(We place "obvious" in quotations because the correct mathematical formulation of those semantics is far from obvious!)
The nitty-gritty details:
We provided a small library and makefile that you have to use for your compiler.
The top-level execution of the compiled Cubex program should be triggered by a call to the function cubex_main() in out.c.
(cubex_main() is forward-declared in cubex_main.h).
The file out.c should include exactly three other files:
cubex_main.h,
cubex_external_functions.h
and cubex_lib.h
and be otherwise self-contained.
The only code allowed to run when a Cubex program is invoked is that in out.c and that in our provided library functions.
A compiler breaking this rule intentionally will get a 0.
